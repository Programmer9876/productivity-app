# Day 6 Reflection
- Built Dashboard with bar graph of historical entry amounts, streak counter and entry statistics (display only), and rotating quote and UI overhaul
- Problems encountered: Graph did not display data, UI display issue of delete button taking up entire space
- Where chat went wrong: Believed user data in entries (fixed by me redirecting it to go for history instead), repeatedly tried to make delete button size of half page (fixed by asking for it to cap size), went in a loop trying to import entrysummary int dashboard.tsx (fixed by seeing app.tsx was implementing barchart not dashboard)
